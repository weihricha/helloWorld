# Hello World Webpage Project Hello! 

I'm a student currently learning about GitHub, GitHub Codespaces, and GitHub Pages. This repository contains my first project: a simple "Hello World" webpage. It's a part of our GIS programming lab where we're exploring the basics of web development and version control. 

## Project Description 

In this project, I: - Created a GitHub repository to understand how version control works. - Used GitHub Codespaces for editing and writing the HTML code for the webpage. - Explored basic HTML and CSS to style the webpage. - Published the webpage using GitHub Pages to understand web hosting. 

## Files in the Repository 

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process. 

## View the Webpage You can view the webpage I created at `https://<my-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Questions or Issues If you have any questions about my project or encounter any issues, please open an issue in this repository, and I'll look into it as soon as possible.
